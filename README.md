THE IDEA

A tap follower is a very usefull tool for any machinist as it frees up a hand when tapping, it is again a very simple project so i decided for it to be my second lathe project.

PROJECT GOALS

For this project, I wanted to learn more basic lathe skills quickly and effieiently as well as try machining in a tougher material (steel), I improved my facing, turning single point threading, tapping, and measurement skills.

MATERIALS

Starting off this project I knew that I would need 2 items 1/2 inch steel round stock and a spring.


BUILDING THE PROJECT

Flowwing Blondihacks i first made the main body, then the cap nut, and lastly the pointer.
